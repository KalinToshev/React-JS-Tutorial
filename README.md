# REAC JS TUTORIAL

This is my starting journey with React JS. Here i will upload all my experience from the journey of learning React. 

In this README file i will upload the link to every source i used, such as youtube tutorials and etc.

My goal is to became a full-stack web developer. So far i have knowedge of Java and Spring framework for the back-end part, and now it's time to learn something for the front-end part, so i decided this to be React. I hope this journey to be fun :)
